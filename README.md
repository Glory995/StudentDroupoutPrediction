## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing student dropout rates using machine learning techniques. The objective is to explore various factors that influence student retention and create a model to predict potential dropouts. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage

Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/Glory995/StudentDroupoutPrediction.git
cd student-dropout-analysis
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt

#Start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open studentdroupout.ipynb and run the cells sequentially.

Notebook Contents
Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and analysis to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict student dropouts.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics and comparison of model performance.
Conclusion and Recommendations: Insights derived from the analysis and potential interventions to reduce dropout rates.
Data
The data used in this analysis is either included in the repository or sourced from publicly available datasets. Please refer to the notebook for details on the data source and any preprocessing steps applied.
